 * initiated, it will call connect() to establish a permanent link to the database. However, it will
 * not throw an error if the connection could not be established due to timeout or something like
 * that. If a connection is needed Modules should use validate() which will test if the connection
 * is alive and attempt to reconnect in case it is not.
 * <p>
 * In case validate() returns false the last Exception will be stored instead of thrown. It might be
 * retrieved using getLastException()
