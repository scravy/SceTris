\emph{A short summary repeating the process, and the product.}

%Our project “Distributed Polling System” is a huge learning experience for us that has taught us to invest more time in proper architecture designing which in-turn reduces heavily the implementation time for any system. In addition to that, the architecture has guided us to segregate the whole system into  granular components that has enriched maximum re-usability and utmost team activity. Even the architecture has  helped  us  to  invest  less  time  for  component  integration  which  has  become evident  while  we started getting expected system behavior after our first time component assembling.

%In spite of having six team members from different cultural background and practices, by investing twenty  hours  per  person  per  week  for  almost  ten  weeks,  we  successfully  designed,  developed, integrated and tested the functionalities. It’s our honor and privilege to be part of such kind of  real time project implementation and we believe we could do further enhancement to this software in different aspects to make it a commercial software.

%Although  we  could  not  invest  much  more  time  due  to  having  parallel  courses  in  the  same curriculum,  we  would  be  grateful  to  work  further  on  this  software  to  make  it  commercially successful.

%This  project  was  done  in  a  quite  short  period  with  an  intensive  workload  (being  that  it  covers  half  university semester), nevertheless we profuse a lot of effort to provide a quality software. We reach this target working day by day, and through iterations in weekly periods and making different level of tests, both during programming and after deployment. We worked adding modules as “services” iteratively, to have always a working and testable version  since  the  first  ones.  We  also  divided  the  project  in  layers  to  make  each  part  as  more  independent  as possible. 

%Six people were involved in this work, from three different countries and belonging to two different universities, who have had different background and knowledge. The first part of project was the hardest because we had to work  hard  to  line  up  all  the  members.  After  that  we  proceeded  quicker  in  creating  the  software  and documentation to make the website easy to use (available to all kinds of people, with different requests). During all  the  developing  process  we  focused  on  making  the  product  extensible  and  ready  to  new  technologies,  like mobile phones.  

%The experience was great for all of us, we learned how to work in team in spite of distance and other working problems,  and  we  also  found  some  friends  more  than  co-workers.  Software  we  produced  is  already  being recognized  by  the  users,  and  with  only  a  few  days  passed  of  spreading  our  word  of  its  existence,  we  gathered many advices to our database. We have given users a great amount of freedom in structuring their advices which can  be  polygons,  lines  or  dots  and  contain  multimedia  information  and  links  to  relevant  advice  Web  page. Administration allows infinite number of advice categories and properties to be added, and with our promotion system, many users can become administrators or moderators thus making information more reliable and useful.
