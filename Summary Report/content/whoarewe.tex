We are a team of five undergraduate students of the Free University of Berlin. Even though  we are all in the same year our knowledge regarding the creation of software and the used technologies varied widely. We were however all inexperienced in project management. Specifically none of us had been part of a software development process before. The members of the team, their age and their most prominent task are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item David Bialik, 23, build automatization, installer
	\item Julian Fleischer, 23, backend development
	\item Hagen Mahnke, 24, project lead
	\item Konrad Reiche, 22, scheduler development
	\item Andre Zoufahl, 22, web interface development
\end{itemize}
