%\begin{multicols}{2}[\subsection{Usability}]

%\emph{MyCourses} is able to create a semi-automatic scheduling for programs at universities or schools. It can also provide a scheduling that was run fully automatic but the recommended usage is to have \emph{MyCourses} create preliminary versions of a scheduling. These will then be improved by the users via the functionality for collaborative scheduling also provided by \emph{MyCourses}. This process is best used iteratively through several cycles of automatic assignment and manual improvement. To get better results from the automated scheduling users can define requirements and assign those to courses or resources. A requirement that is assigned to a course is regarded as a constraint that either must be met in case of a so called hard-constraint or simply improves the rating of a scheduling in case of a soft-constraint.

All in one the application provides the following functionality (illustration follows)

\begin{itemize}
\item login/logout and get detailed information about your personal profile

\item create, read, delete and modify data related to schedules

\item automatic validation of all forms

\item starting, resuming of schedulings with progress indicator

\item view timetables for a given room, a \emph{CourseInstance} and every user

\item import and export of course-related data

\item view courseinstance data and enroll in them

\item full accessibility on current browsers, even without JavaScript
\end{itemize}
